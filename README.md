# PyNGL

PyNGL ("pingle") is a Python module built on top of [NCL](http://www.ncl.ucar.edu)'s graphics library, which produces publication-quality, two-dimensional visualizations tailored for climate and weather data.

Interfaces exist for the display of:

 * Contour plots
 * XY plots
 * World map projections
 * Vector plots
 * Streamline plots

PyNGL is developed by the [Computational and Information Systems Lab](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu), and is funded by the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov).

# Installation

PyNGL can be installed on Linux and MacOS systems via [conda](https://conda.io/docs/):

```
conda create --name pyn_env --channel conda-forge pynio pyngl
source activate pyn_env
```
